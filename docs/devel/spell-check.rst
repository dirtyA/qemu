Spell Check
===========

QEMU uses British or American English in code and documentation. There
are some typical spelling bugs which can be easily avoided by using
tools like ``codespell``.

`codespell <https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell>`__ is a
Python script which detects (and optionally fixes) the most common
spelling bugs.  It is packaged for most common Linux distributions.
